# TuftsPacman
# To run this code you need to import pygame, OS, time and random
# You also need to download Anaconda to run this code
# This is a very basic recreation of Pacman in python with only one level and with the ghosts not even having strategies (their movements are random).  Also Pacman and the ghosts aren't animated objects but instead a yellow circle and four colored squares.
# In the future we may update the game by including Pacman and ghosts more close to their original design.  We may also include more levels as well as program the individual ghosts to follow certain strategies.
