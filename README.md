# Rendition of Pacman
## Libraries
### This code is based off of the python libraries pygame, Random, and Time.  These libraries need to be installed and running the latest version to ensure compatibility.  Anaconda can be used to manage packages effectively and ensure version compatibility.  The links to download instructions for each library are below.

## About the Program
### This is a very basic recreation of Pacman in python with only one level and with the ghosts not even having strategies (their movements are random).  Also Pacman and the ghosts aren't animated objects but instead a yellow circle and four colored squares.
## Future Plans
 ### In the future we may update the game by including Pacman and ghosts more close to their original design.  We may also include more levels as well as program the individual ghosts to follow certain strategies.
